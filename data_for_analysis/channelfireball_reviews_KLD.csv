"Accomplished Automaton",1.0,"Despite my enduring love for Hexplate Golem, I canÅft realistically claim that Accomplished Automaton is going to live up to its name. A 6/8 or a 5/7 + a 1/1 is a passable deal for 7?mana, but IÅfd hope that you can do better. Where this may fit is in control decks that need finishers and canÅft pick anything else up, making it a card you can likely get?almost automatically as a late pick."
"Aetherflux Reservoir",1.0,"Setting aside the second part of the card, this is a fairly powerful life gain engine. At one spell per turn, it does very little, but once you play two spells a turn you are gaining 3?life, and the third spell nets you another 3. An artifact that simply said Åggain 2 life per turnÅh would be a solid control card, and this reads as slightly worse than that to me. ItÅfs not outside the realm of playable, but requires enough spells that IÅfm skeptical of it actually delivering.As for the 50 life partÅ\that isnÅft really a factor. You arenÅft getting to 50 life in games you are losing?anyway."
"Aetherworks Marvel",1.0/3.5,"This is the classic build-around grade, where the card goes from unplayable to marvelous, depending on the rest of your deck. This doesnÅft do a ton until you get to 6?energy, but once you do it draws you a card (with a lot of selection) and adds a bunch of mana, which is a sizable reward. It also combines well with tokens that die, and really gives you an edge if you prolong the game. I think this card works. It needs to be activated twice to pay for itself, but in a tokens/energy deck, that seems doable. I wouldnÅft move all-in on it over a solid removal spell, though I would take this if my deck was already heading in a direction to support it."
"Animation Module",1.0/2.5,"Animation Module also gets a build-around grade (there are a lot of cards like this in the set), but here the ceiling is a lot lower. You need to make 3?or 4?Servos to get value from this, and even though it fuels itself with the second ability, it still needs +1/+1 counters somewhere to get started. In the deck that wants this, it seems solid but not amazing, and most decks are not going to want it."
"Aradara Express",1.5,"I guess the Vehicles train starts here. LetÅfs get to it.Vehicles are more like a new take on equipment than they are creatures, though there are similarities to both. Because they require creatures to function, they fill noncreature nonremoval slots in your deck, meaning that having too many Vehicles is a big risk. The higher crew numbers also scale very rapidlyÅ\crew 4 is a much bigger cost than crew 2, because of how often you wonÅft be able to activate those higher numbers.What Vehicles do well is give you an inflated set of stats to cost, meaning that if you successfully crew them, you get a good deal from your card. They also dodge sorcery-speed removal, and have a bunch of positive interactions with Pilots (creatures that give bonuses to the Vehicles they crew).This isnÅft one of the better vehicles, just because of how much you have to pay in terms of mana and crew cost. ItÅfs adding 4 damage to the board, though menace and giant stats means that the Express may get through when the crew wouldnÅft. This plays to my fears of paying a bunch of mana for a Vehicle and having my opponent bounce/kill it after activating, or killing off potential crew and leaving me with a brick.The Express seems like a passable high-end card in a deck full of creatures, but is largely worse than other Vehicles that are competing for the same slots."
"Ballista Charger",3.0,"Even though IÅfm getting charged the same amount of mana for this as Aradara Express, I like this one a lot more. One less crew number is big, and pinging for 1?means that you will often be able to set up turns where you get to kill one of their creatures for free. That makes this easier to use and easier to reach card parity, meaning that even if there are turns where it doesnÅft work, you arenÅft down so?much."
"Bastion Mastodon",1.0,"For this cycle of creatures with colored activations, I will often provide two ratings. Bastion Mastodon doesnÅft warrant that, as itÅfs mediocre whether you have white mana or not. You may well end up playing this if you need a random artifact body, but itÅfs nothing exciting."
"Bomat Bazaar Barge",3.5,"ItÅfd be bizarre for me to dislike a giant threat that draws a card, and this meets my requirements for a card IÅfd be willing to take early. You can still be stuck paying 4?mana for a card that just cycles, so make sure to have a decent number of creatures in your deck, though the risk is much lower with this than other Vehicles."
"Bomat Courier",0.5,"This has interesting implications in Constructed, but in Limited itÅfs often going to be a lot of work just to get a card or two (and you are probably discarding that many anyway). A 1/1 will die in combat often enough that you arenÅft stacking a bunch of cards under this, so you are paying a card and discarding your hand to draw maybe two cards? I can appreciate sending a message, but this one comes at too high a setup cost."
"Chief of the Foundry",3.0,"It doesnÅft take much before this justifies a slot in your deck, as a 3-mana 2/3 is only a little below what I like to pay for stats. Chief among your concerns should be picking up fabricate cards, but even Vehicles benefit nicely from this, and crewing them with it is a pretty sweet combo. This is low risk and high reward, making it a solid early pick."
"CogworkerÅfs Puzzleknot",1.0,"This whole cycle is knot playable if you canÅft activate the second ability, and in the case of this one, even if you can. Paying 4?mana for two 1/1s is just not a good deal, and the only way I can really envision playing this is if you are black-white and have a ton of artifact-matters cards."
"Consulate Skygate",1.0,"In a land of Vehicles, a defender that just sits there and doesnÅft punish the opponent for attacking is not what you're looking for. Vehicles mean that you will eventually be attacked by undercosted monsters, none of which get stopped by the Skygate, and even the go-wide fabricate decks wonÅft be deterred by this. I donÅft mind having one of these to sideboard in against flier decks, but past that IÅfm not into it."
"CultivatorÅfs Caravan",3.5,"I really like CultivatorÅfs Caravan. ItÅfs a real card even if you canÅft crew it, as it accelerates you and fixes your mana, and then later it becomes a gigantic threat. ThatÅfs exactly the kind of split card IÅfm looking for, where flexibility plus power meet."
"Deadlock Trap",1.5,"I feel like IÅfm saying this about a lot of the energy cards, but this doesnÅft do enough on its own. There is a real reward for combining enough cards that make and use energy, so that deck is clearly going to exist, but cards like Deadlock Trap are just anemic without support. If you have reliable sources of energy, this locks down a creature a turn, which is great. If you donÅft, it gets two shots, and thatÅfs not worth a card.Also, for those asking, this is not one of the 10 biggest traps in Limited. It only costs 3!"
"Decoction Module",1.0/2.0,"IÅfm underwhelmed by Decoction Module. First of all, itÅfs clearly an energy build-around that goes very deep. You can generate a lot from it, but need plenty of creatures and ways to spend energy before this pays you back for the card you invested. That is a possibility, but makes?this closer to a late pick when you are drafting energy than an early pick to build around. The second ability is useful in the late game as well, though still not enough to warrant playing this without plenty of synergies."
"Demolition Stomper",1.0,"This is exactly the kind of Vehicle that I predict will crash and burn. It just takes too many resources to get this going, and the payoff isnÅft there. In some matchups it might work, but itÅfs way more of a sideboard card against board stalls. I just fear getting stomped by removal, or drawing this and not drawing 5?power worth of creatures."
"Dukhara Peafowl",1.0/2.5,"If you arenÅft playing blue, this is mediocre filler. If you are, this is a solid addition to the menagerie. "
"Dynavolt Tower",1.0/3.5,"IÅfm not going to say that IÅfm completely unbiased here, but a spells-matter build-around is right up my alley. If you can combine this with a lot of energy-granting spells and some energy creatures, it can toast your opponent very quickly. This looks like enough of a payoff to take early, as it both produces energy and gives you a good outlet for it. ItÅfs also clearly unplayable in most decks, hence the double rating."
"Eager Construct",1.5,"If you need a 2/2 for 2, I wonÅft hound you for playing this. The ability is neutral to slightly negative (they technically get to make use of the scry first, because they draw their card before you do). This is also an artifact, making some decks slightly more interested than they other would be."
"Electrostatic Pummeler",1.5,"By itself, this is more of a punching bag than the reverse. A 1/1 that can make itself a 2/2 once is shockingly mediocre, so this really needs the right deck. In the heavy-energy deck, I still donÅft see the ability being activated all that easily, so IÅfm a little more interested in playing this as an energy creator (at which point itÅfs still medium). This does play nicely with pump spells, but overall IÅfm going to say this is a decent addition to energy decks but not quite a build-around."
"Fabrication Module",1.0/3.5,"What kind of Fabrication Module doesnÅft make Servos? Sounds like false advertising to me. What this does do is provide you a good payoff for energy, while also fueling itself. It doesnÅft seem hard to get a +1/+1 counter from this each turn, possibly more, and it does that without requiring a ton of mana. Once you do get to the stage in the game where you can spend 4?on its activated ability, it gives you multiple resources, and all that together sounds like a card IÅfm willing to put some energy into."
"Filigree Familiar",3.0,"You just canÅft go wrong with this. ItÅfs an Exultant Cultist thatÅfs easier to cast and gains you 2?life, and Exultant Cultist was already a fine card. ItÅfs possible that the various artifact synergies and ways to get this back warrant giving it a higher grade, but IÅfll start at 3.0 and take it like it was a 3.5."
"FireforgerÅfs Puzzleknot",0.5,"1?damage for 2?mana is medium at best, even if you have the option of paying 2R for another damage on top of that. IÅfd fire this off out of the sideboard against a deck with a lot of x/1s, but I wouldnÅft look to start it."
"Fleetwheel Cruiser",3.5,"This does a lot of damage very quickly, as the name implies. ItÅfs got good stats, gets to attack once even if you donÅft have any creatures, and the crew cost is not prohibitively high. The combination of good rate and value even if you donÅft initially have a crew makes this one of the better Vehicles."
"Foundry Inspector",3.0,"IÅfve found cost reduction to be underrated in Limited (though appropriately rated in Constructed). If you reduce even one artifact in a relevant way, youÅfve gotten a solid deal, and playing 2-4 over the course of the game doesnÅft sound unrealistic. Foundry Inspector is a fine card to take early and has the potential to be one of the better cards in your deck."
"Ghirapur Orrery",0.0,"This could be great... orr not. ThereÅfs just no reliable way to break the symmetry here, and paying 4?mana for that is not a good game plan. Maybe if your deck is insanely low curve and your opponentÅfs is high curve, but most Limited decks just donÅft look like that."
"GlassblowerÅfs Puzzleknot",1.0,"If you are the blue deck that really cares about energy, you can pick these up, because they are wildly unplayable in every other deck. ThatÅfs not actually a bad place to be, since I like cards that only specific decks care about."
"InventorÅfs Goggles",2.0,"The cost-to-stats ratio here isnÅft mind-goggling, but itÅfs passable. I wouldnÅft worry too much about making an Artificer deck, and would just play this if I had a high creature count and a few slots to use on this type of card."
"Iron League Steed",3.0,"Both sides of this card are great, making this a real workhorse no matter what you decide. Most fabricate cards tend to land with a Servo, but because this gives haste to the +1/+1 counter, I suspect this will come out as a 3/3 more often."
"Key to the City",3.5,"This definitely would make a list of LSVÅfs Keys to Limited, as itÅfs a powerful engine in multiple ways. It gets damage through and lets you increase your card quality, all at relatively low cost. You do need a fair amount of creatures before this gets appealing, but the payoff is high enough that I would encourage you to take it and find those creatures."
"MetalspinnerÅfs Puzzleknot",1.0,"Once again, Puzzleknots arenÅft worth the total mana investment. Where this does have some merit is in a black deck that cares about artifacts, and if you are in that deck, I suspect it wonÅft be a puzzle to find these."
"Metalwork Colossus",3.0,"The greatest Pilot on Kaladesh is somehow Metalwork Colossus, as it plays so nicely with Vehicles. IÅfm not entirely sure how it fits into them, but they are the most common way to reduce the cost of this. If you can get that cost down to 7 or so, youÅfve got a fine deal on your hands, and sacrificing Servos and whatnot to bring this back does make it an enduring threat. Not every deck can play this, much like half the cards in the set, so treat this is a reasonable payoff for an artifact deck that needs a finisher."
"Multiform Wonder",4.0,"I would say that this card is wonderful, but thatÅfs just too easy. I only note that to show you how much restraint I have. The card is legit great, as it can attack as a 5/1 flying lifelink with the energy it provides, while efficiently using any other sources of energy to your benefit. Multiform Wonder is a card IÅfd always be happy to play, and gets much, much better if you can provide it a constant source of fuel."
"Narnam Cobra",1.5/3.0,"A 2-mana 2/1 is playable in some decks that need low drops, though thatÅfs not very exciting. A 2/1 that can gain deathtouch is a great card, as itÅfs good both early and late. IÅfd be happy with Cobra if I were green, and medium unhappy otherwise."
"Ovalchase Dragster",2.5,"At first I was pretty down on this card, given how fragile it is, but haste really helps. You can often set up a turn where you get to crack for 6, and then when the opponent leaves something back, you either wait until you can remove it or trade and get more damage through. Crew 1 makes the Vehicle drawback much less risky, and overall this is going to get more than 4?manaÅfs worth of value. It even blocks well, making it a fine card in slower decks (assuming they have enough creatures)."
"Panharmonicon",0.0(ExceptforthatonetimewhereitÅfsgreat),"This doubles up a lot of stuff in the set, but the number of those cards youÅfd need is so high that I doubt itÅfs realistic. If you get there, more power (and toughness) to you."
"Perpetual Timepiece",0.5,"ThereÅfs not a lot going on here besides spinning of wheels, though the joke is that you mill your deck and then shuffle in all the good cards. While that is technically possible, I donÅft see it happening often enough to comfortably advise that anyone play with this."
"Prakhata Pillar-Bug",1.5,"Much like the Mastodon, this is not really dependent on you having black mana. If you need a 3-mana 2/3, then IÅfm sorry for you, and you can play this."
"Prophetic Prism",2.5,"Mana-fixing at extremely low opportunity cost is always nice to have, and Prophetic Prism is a card IÅfd look to play in most decks. It becomes even better if you need artifacts for some reason, and is really only bad in a 2-color deck that already has a lot of low drops. This doesnÅft look like a 3-color format, but if you want to splash, this is one of the best ways."
"Renegade Freighter",3.0,"The stats on this train are the kind of payoff IÅfm looking for. It has a low crew cost and is one of the easier-to-add Vehicles, making it a card most aggro or midrange decks will be happy to play."
"Scrapheap Scrounger",2.5,"Its inability to block makes this way less annoying than it would be otherwise while also restricting it mainly to aggressive decks. IÅfm fine with both, and would value this closer to a 3.5 once I know IÅfm in a black aggressive deck."
"Self-Assembler",1.5(then2.5,then3.0,thenbackto2.0),"The rating on Self-Assembler is a little odd. The first one isnÅft worth much, and IÅfd look to pick it up later in the pack. Once you have one, the second and third are worth picking mid-pack, as a 4/4 that draws another 4/4 is a good deal. The fourth and fifth are likely unnecessary, so the rating once again dips downwards.?"
"Sky Skiff",3.0,"The cost is low (both in crew and mana), making this a spiffy card indeed. ItÅfs a fine little beater, and one IÅfd look to include in most decks."
"Skysovereign, Consul Flagship",5.0,"Welp. ThereÅfs a reason this is the flagship Vehicle of the set, as it provides a ton of power at a very reasonable cost. Even if you never crew it, itÅfs a 5-mana deal 3, which is passable, and if it ever takes flight you get to destroy your opponent. IÅfd slam Consul Flagship and make sure I had ample crew, then I would collect my profits."
"SmugglerÅfs Copter",4.0,"This may be my pick for best Constructed card in the set, but itÅfs no slouch in Limited. ItÅfs not as high-impact as some cards (see: Consul Flagship), though the low cost and ease of use go a long way. This just gets to attack so often and improve your card quality while doing so, all for just 2 mana and crew 1."
"Snare Thopter",3.0,"IÅfve never been unhappy about a 4-mana 3/2 flier, and giving it haste plus an easier casting cost sweetens the deal nicely."
"Torch Gauntlet",1.0,"The combo here is to equip a small creature and crew a Vehicle, but now we are talking about equipment + Vehicles, which is a lot of noncreature space. Between that risk and the fact that you can equip and still be forced to trade down, IÅfm not thrilled about Torch Gauntlet. It can do some work in a Servo-heavy deck, you just will normally be able to do better."
"Weldfast Monitor",1.5/2.0,"If you need a cheap artifact creature and donÅft mind playing a little fast and loose, this is a fine card to lean on. It improves a little bit with the addition of red mana, but not enough to move the needle in most cases."
"Whirlermaker",1.0,"I know, I just know, that IÅfm going to lose badly to this card. That still doesnÅft stop me from giving it a low grade, because it just seems way too slow to be realistic. There are decks where itÅfs a plausible finisher, and matchups where IÅfd love to side it in, but you canÅft just go about putting in cards that cost this much mana to use and succeed. 7 mana for a Thopter, 11 mana for twoÅ\thatÅfs not acceptable unless the game is going to go VERY long."
"WoodweaverÅfs Puzzleknot",1.0,"The same caveats that apply to the blue Puzzleknot are true hereÅ\energy decks may want this, nobody else will. IÅfm usually pretty excited about cycles like this, but the Puzzleknots are living up to their name, and itÅfs hard to make use of them effectively."
"Workshop Assistant",1.5,"In an artifact-heavy deck that has sacrifice effects and lots of ways to get this back, it can do some real work. Otherwise, itÅfs gonna sit on the sidelines. I also like that MishraÅfs Workshop casts thisÅ\good naming."
"Acrobatic Maneuver",2.0,"Without any combos, this card protects one of your creatures from a removal spell, untaps a surprise blocker, or lets you chump something gigantic and keep your creature. ThatÅfs pretty good for a 3-mana cantrip, and things really get interesting in decks with a bunch of creatures with enters-the-battlefield abilities. At that point, Acrobatic Maneuver becomes both flexible and powerful, and an easy inclusion."
"Aerial Responder",3.5,"I know IÅfm not the first to get there, but thereÅfs no way this doesnÅft end up being called Vampire Whitehawk. It wonÅft be as dominant as its namesake, and vigilance is surely worse than deathtouch, but itÅfs still going to be a great card. It can bash for a 4-point life swing, crew vehicles on defense, and is a lot of stats for low cost. "
"Aetherstorm Roc",5.0,"ThereÅfs a lot going on here, all great. First of all, the Roc is a 3/3 flier for 4, which is already good. Second, it generates a lot of energy, starting with the one you get when you play it, and there are plenty of other cards that care about that. Plus, all you have to do is play a creature before attacking on the next turn and you get to use the last ability, which is awesome. Tapping down their blockers and growing the Roc is a huge offensive threat, making this a brutal card to defend against. All of these abilities combined make the Roc one of the best first picks in the format."
"Angel of Invention",4.5,"Even if white didnÅft invent the bomb rare, it may have perfected it. Angel of Invention checks all the boxes I look for:You will usually want to play this as a 2/1, as it brings two 2/2 Servos along to the party and is more resilient to removal. Sometimes you will need the 4 points of lifelink and will opt for a 4/3, at which point you are still getting a great deal. No matter what you choose, you are going to be in very good shape, and I canÅft imagine passing this if I open it.Note on fabricate: With this card, as with most, making Servos will be the default use. ItÅfs just better against so many cardsÅ\think about the counters as an Aura, and the tokens as almost another card. That doesnÅft mean you will never want +1/+1 counters, but it will happen less often than the alternative."
"Authority of the Consuls",0.5,"The Consuls may have the authority, but they seem a little confused with how to wield it. Tapping down the opponentÅfs creatures is an ability you want in an aggressive deck, but gaining a life per creature is more on the controlling side. I suppose this does let you win a race, but being down a card on Authority of the Consuls is a pretty big cost. Even if you are absurdly aggressive, drawing this at the wrong time makes it completely useless. IÅfm going to pass on this one."
"Aviary Mechanic",3.0,"This does a couple neat things. ItÅfs a 2/2 for 2, which some decks are definitely on board for, and it can pick up any of your ETB creatures or permanents (like the Puzzleknot cycle). The ability is strictly upside, and even if you donÅft have any synergies, this can rescue a creature from a negative Aura or untap a creature after you attack with it. Low cost and decent upside make this an easy include."
"Built to Last",2.5,"1 mana for +2/+2 is becoming a standard, and itÅfs a fine place to land. You donÅft need to have artifact creatures to make this good, just a desire for pump spells, even if the second part is a nice bonus. IÅfd play this in aggro decks, try and take it about the middle of the pack, and I'd be fine cutting it if I donÅft have a ton of creatures."
"Captured by the Consulate",3.5,"Captured by the Consulate is an interesting twist on Pacifism. It is a rare, so itÅfs not coming up all the often, but thatÅfs because of the complexity. What this does is turn one of their creatures into a defender, while also blanking all of your opponentÅfs pump spells and removal spells. ThatÅfs a hugely powerful effect, and well worth the disadvantage of not being able to attack past the enchanted creature."
"Cataclysmic Gearhulk",4.0,"These Gearhulks are amazing. This isnÅft quite Tragic Arrogance, because each player makes their own decisions, but forcing the opponent to sac down to their best creature + artifact while keeping your own (one of which is likely a 4/5) is a very powerful effect. It doesnÅft solve your problems if the opponent has one gigantic creature, but on most boards this will give you a sizable advantage at a?reasonable cost. If you know this is coming, trying to kill off your opponentÅfs artifact creatures and leave them with all nonartifacts (or vice-versa) is a good plan."
"Consulate Surveillance",1.5,"By itself, Consulate Surveillance prevents all damage to you from a source twice, which is definitely not what IÅfm looking for when I spend 4 mana. Where this gets a little more interesting is if you are using its energy to power other cards or using energy from other cards to power this. The output of preventing damage to you isnÅft strong enough that IÅfm too excited about making this a build-around, so whether you want this will mostly hinge on how you can use the 4 energy it provides."
"ConsulÅfs Shieldguard",3.0,"The flavor judge approves of the Shieldguard not protecting itself, though as a 3/4 itÅfs going to do a solid job of surviving combat regardless. This plays nicely with other energy cards (both in creating and spending energy) and is big enough that IÅfd play it even if I werenÅft aggressive."
"Eddytrail Hawk",2.0,"The Hawk, on the other hand, is way more aggressive in nature. It does a good job of getting damage through, poking in for 1 a turn and giving a lift to your biggest creature twice, while also having natural energy synergies. The power level on this is high enough that aggro decks will always play and be happy with it, but itÅfs focused enough on attacking that control decks wonÅft be interested."
"Fairgrounds Warden",3.5,"As with every time weÅfve seen this effect, itÅfs a solid addition to any Limited deck. You get rid of their best creature for as long as you can keep a 1/3 around, which offers the opportunity for a 2-for-1. This also plays nicely with the multiple flicker and bounce effects in the set, letting you choose a new creature to nab. "
"Fragmentize",2.5,"The way this format is looking, IÅfm inclined to maindeck Fragmentize. It seems like most decks will have a couple targets at least, and a 1-mana removal spell doesnÅft have to be that flexible to still be worth including. ItÅfs definitely great in Sealed, and a good way to shore up a removal-light deck in Draft (though be ready to side it out if you donÅft see good targets to hit)."
"Fumigate",4.0,"While I donÅft think wraths stink in Limited, IÅfm historically a little lower on them than most people. This one is good enough that IÅfm optimistic, as itÅfs cheap enough and gives you a life buffer that lets you slowroll it at least one extra turn. ItÅfs a great combo with Vehicles, though, in that vein, itÅfs bad against them, making it highly variable depending on the composition of your opponentÅfs deck. Still, this is a solid early pick, and seems like gas even in an aggressive deck."
"Gearshift Ace",3.0,"Given that IÅfd always play a 2/1 first strike for 2, it doesnÅft take much to sell me on Gearshift Ace. You do have incentive to pick up Vehicles once you have this, but donÅft feel like itÅfs in any way necessary. I also think it should be mandatory to sleeve your deck if you draft one of these."
"Glint-Sleeve Artisan",3.0,"I will never cut this from a Limited deck, and will actively seek out as many as possible. A 2/2 plus a 1/1 is a great deal for 3 mana, and gives you more artifacts to play with (or crew Vehicles). Worst comes to worst, making a 3/3 in the face of opposing 2/2s and 2/3s is good, and thereÅfs no way to lose out when you add this to your deck."
"Herald of the Fair",1.5,"This is fair at best, and not the kind of card IÅfm going to prioritize drafting. The ETB ability will sometimes let you force a couple extra points of damage through, but isnÅft so powerful that this is anything but a filler card with filler stats."
"Impeccable Timing",3.0,"There arenÅft that many phases where you can even play this, so your timing will at most be decent. This will trade for what you want it to often enough that itÅfs a good card in midrange and playable in aggro."
"Inspired Charge",1.0,"I wasnÅft inspired last time, and I donÅft think things have changed a ton. Some go-wide fabricate decks will want this, but nobody else will, so it shouldnÅft be hard to pick one up."
"Master Trinketeer",3.5,"You are getting a lot of bang for your buck with Master Trinketeer, though I wouldnÅft read too much into his activated ability. ItÅfs part of what makes the card powerful, but in my experience with similar cards, you donÅft actually get a chance to repeatedly spam the ability all that often. Where he truly becomes masterful is in a fabricate-heavy deck, at which point he can be 5?or 6 power without spending any additional mana. "
"Ninth Bridge Patrol",2.0,"ItÅfs somewhat ironic that this Patrol is perfect at keeping unruly mobs under control, given how similar the two cards are. Ninth Bridge Patrol is going to be good in tokens-based strategies?and has the additional bonus of counting when your creatures get bounced or flickered (which white does with a few different cards). You donÅft need a lot to want to play this, as one or two counters later you have a great card. "
"Pressure Point",2.5,"Cheap utility cards like this are easy to include even if they donÅft have a ton of impact. IÅfd rarely cut Pressure Point, but I also wouldnÅft prioritize taking it unless I was drafting a very aggressive deck."
"Propellor Pioneer",3.0,"A 3/2 flier for 4 is solid, and a 2/1 flier plus a 1/1 is even better, propelling this into the upper echelon of picks. That this has flying makes the fabricate choice a little closer, as you get to put the 1/1 worth of stats into the air if you choose to get a counter. Either way, you are getting a good deal."
"Refurbish",1.0,"Much like Zombify-type cards, IÅfm not a huge fan of Refurbish. When it works, you paid 4 mana for an artifact that probably cost about 4. When it doesnÅft, itÅfs a dead card. The risk of being dead plus the low reward makes me unexcited."
"Revoke Privileges",3.5,"This effect is always great, and IÅfm happy to pay 3 mana for it. The twist in this set is that it prevents the creature from driving any kind of Vehicle, which is a relevant bonus."
"Servo Exhibition",2.0,"ItÅfs interesting that this is an uncommon, which may serve as a clue as to what the developers think of the power level. On the surface, itÅfs not exceptional, providing 2/2 worth of stats for 2 mana. Where it gets alarming is when you put it in a go-wide deck thatÅfs capable of raising the stats of these Servos, and thatÅfs typically going to be GW."
"Skyswirl Harrier",3.0,"Simple, clean, and well-costed. ThereÅfs a little swirl of french in this vanilla, and the cost and stats are good enough that IÅfll always look to pick one of these up."
"SkywhalerÅfs Shot",3.5,"Once you start talking about 3 power instead of 4, this stops being situational removal and starts just being removal. IÅfd take be happy to take a Shot first pick."
"Tasseled Dromedary",1.0,"If you could crew vehicles with this, I might be a little more into it, but it makes sense that you canÅftÅ\can you imagine a camel piloting a racecar?This looks like pure sideboard material to me, and not particularly exciting even there. Having zero power is just such a big hump to get over, and there will be too many games where this doesnÅft have nearly the impact you need from your cards."
"Thriving Ibex",3.0,"Similar to fabricate, this cycle gives you a solid deal no matter how you use the energy. A 4-mana 3/5 (once it gets to attack) is great, and having two energy to use on other cards is also perfectly acceptable. This can even consume energy from other sources if it comes to that, and overall I will be happy to play as many of these as I can get."
"Toolcraft Exemplar",1.5,"If you donÅft have an artifact, this is barely a card. Once you make it a 3/2, you get a solid attacker, and if you can get it to first strike, it becomes a beast. ItÅfs hard to end up playing this, as you need to be aggressive and artifact-heavy, though once you meet those conditions you do end up with a pretty solid threat."
"Trusty Companion",2.0,"A 3/2 vigilance for 2 isnÅft such a great deal that IÅfm excited about it, though itÅfs certainly fine. Note that this can block still, making it reasonable even in a defensive deck."
"Visionary Augmenter",3.5,"Getting a 2/1 and two 1/1s is fantastic, and will be the main mode of this card. You will occasionally play it as a 4/3, and having that flexibility makes an already good card even better."
"Wispweaver Angel",3.5,"In a deck without good combos, this is a slightly overcosted 4/4 flier, which is still a fine playable. Add even a few enters-the-battlefield triggers to the mix and it becomes very appealing, which is what the grade is based on. It shouldnÅft be hard to make this one of your better cards, as the cards that it combos with are good and easy to find."
"Aether Meltdown",3.0,"Power-shrinking seems to be where blue gets a lot of its removal these days, and Aether Meltdown is a solid example. It will do a good job trading for a medium or small creature, and the 2 energy you get are not hard to find a use for."
"Aether Theorist",3.0,"This sounds great to me in theory, and I suspect it will hold up in practice. ItÅfs a 1/3 that comes with three scrys attached, and you can even spend its energy in other places (or spend other energy scrying). ThatÅfs awesome, and this is going to be one of the better blue commons. I could see bumping it up to a 3.5, depending on how often blue decks end up caring about energy."
"Aether Tradewinds",2.0,"This wasnÅft spectacular last time we saw it, but thereÅfs a lot going on in Kaladesh that makes me interested in doing some trading. First of all, bouncing your own cards with ETB abilities is going to be easier, given how many there are. Second, bouncing crewed Vehicles or potential crew can wreak havoc on attacking and blocking plans, making midcombat bounce more valuable than it would be otherwise. I wouldnÅft look to play this without combos, but it shouldnÅft be too hard to find some."
"Aethersquall Ancient",3.5,"In some games, this will be a 7-mana 6/6 flier that eats a removal spell. In others, it will completely dominate the game. It plays very nicely with other energy cards, and if you can get to 8 energy before playing this then you have an absurd bomb on your hands. ItÅfs still a little too vulnerable to get a true bomb rating, but itÅfs close."
"Ceremonious Rejection",1.5,"I wouldnÅft reject this out of hand, but itÅfs not a card IÅfm likely to start in Draft. I will in Sealed, as the odds that your opponent has a couple good artifacts go way up, but it is too likely to be dead in Draft. It leads to a significant mana advantage when it works, but thatÅfs not worth the risk of it doing nothing."
"Confiscation Coup",5.0,"Well then, it looks like Mind Control is back. By itself, this steals any creature or artifact with cost 4 or less, which is absurd. IÅfd windmill slam this even if I knew it was going to be the only energy card IÅfd draft, because that effect is just too good. You are up a card and mana (paying 5 to steal a 4-drop is still highly mana efficient, because whatever card the 4 trades for is going to cost more than 1).Once you start adding other energy cards to the mix, this gets even more absurd, not that it needs it."
"Curio Vendor",1.5,"In a land of Servos and Thopters, 2/1s for 2 look even worse than usual (and IÅfve never been the biggest fan). IÅfd mostly avoid, with the caveat that sometimes you need to do something before turn 4."
"Disappearing Act",1.5,"The value of this is mostly predicated on how much you want a 3-mana counterspell. My assumption is that you arenÅft going to want it every time, even with an interesting rider. The additional cost can be both drawback or advantage, though IÅfd lean toward it being an advantage in most decks and at most stages of the game. This isnÅft that hard a thread to followÅ\do you want a 3-mana counter, and do you have synergies with bounce? If the answer to both is yes, play this card."
"Dramatic Reversal",0.0,"In a dramatic twist, a card that doesnÅft add any stats, replace itself, or do anything but untap your permanents is not a good card. Do not play this."
"Era of Innovation",1.0/3.0,"There are so many build-arounds in this set, leading to a lot of 1.0/X ratings. We truly are in the best possible era, as build-arounds are what I live for in Draft. This one looks solid to me, providing you with a steady stream of energy and a way to sink it, which artifact/artificer heavy decks will be glad to make use of. This is also unplayable in tons of decks, but good enough that I wouldnÅft hate to move in early on it."
"Experimental Aviator",,"I prefer experimental aviators, myself.Second-rate Aviators aside, this is a solid card. It provides 2/5 worth of flying stats, which is good for 5 mana, and the 0/3 combos perfectly with the various bounce and flicker effects. It also ups your artifact count, and is hard to combat with a removal spell."
"Failed Inspection",1.0,"Would you loot? What if you had to pay 4 mana for the privilege, even with a counterspell attached? In general, IÅfm going to say no, as leaving 4?mana up is just too punishing if they donÅft play into it. This is a good sideboard card, and seems solid in Sealed."
"Gearseeker Serpent",3.0,"I like the look of this. I have an affinity for solid finishers, and this is a great way for a blue deck to close out a game. You will often cast this for 5?mana, at which point itÅfs a great deal, and you have outs to pay even less. The unblockable ability is a nice bonus too, and will be relevant more than you might think."
"Glimmer of Genius",3.0,"IÅfm in for everything about this card. Scry 2 + draw 2 is very close to a draw 3/4, depending on the stage of the game (once lands become worth 0, this is much closer to draw 4). Getting 2?energy makes this a great deal, and it being an instant is just icing on the already-delicious cake."
"Glint-Nest Crane",3.0,"With only six artifacts in your deck, you are still 50/50 to see one or more with this. ThatÅfs a very good deal, and it shouldnÅft be hard to end up with more than six artifacts. IÅfm a fan of this, and will be drafting it aggressively."
"Hightide Hermit",1.5,"With a name like Hightide Hermit, I expected you to be able to remove energy counters to make your Islands tap for extra blue mana, but no such luck. As is, Hightide Hermit is a passable card if you donÅft have other energy cards, and gets upgraded to solid once you do. This is more of an energy creator than an energy sink, as a 4/4 that gets to attack isnÅft the most exciting."
"Insidious Will",3.5,"The upside on this is high enough that IÅfm willing to risk the times when I keep mana up for it and am not presented with a good target. The key here is that it is a 4-mana unconditional counter at worst, so if you leave this up you can counter a creature or whatever the opponent plays on their turn. If they happen to play a removal spell, you utterly destroy them, and thereÅfs even the chance that you want to copy their (or your) spell, though thatÅfs going to be the least-used mode. ItÅfs also disgusting if you attack and your opponent plays a trick or removal spell midcombat, as your mana is naturally going to be untapped.This loses some value once the opponent knows about it, but the high end is so high that itÅfs a good card overall."
"Janjeet Sentry",3.0,"By itself, this is a fine card. A 2/3 for 3?with a one-shot tap or untap ability is decent. It gets more interesting in an energy deck, but overall isnÅft dependent on that nor does it really change all that much."
"Long-Finned Skywhale",3.0,"I donÅft know why, but this name is very funny to me. The card is also pretty good, though the 3.0 rating is a bit deceptiveÅ\not every deck will play this, because of how bad a blocker it is, but itÅfs easily a 3.0 on power level. As long as you are moderately aggressive, Skywhale is your best bud, so make sure that you care about attacking before playing it. I also wouldnÅft have guessed that the Skywhale is a paragon of aggression, but here we are."
"Malfunction",3.0,"Despite Sleep Paralysis being unexciting, you did always play this, and Malfunction is Sleep Paralysis with a slight upside. IÅfm all for choosing function over form, and this will do well despite feeling clunky."
"Metallurgic Summonings",1.0/4.0,"In the average deck, this is unplayable trash. In a deck with 10+ spells itÅfs a huge game, and worth building around. IÅfm going to start out the format by picking it early, but itÅfs possible that such decks just arenÅft a real thing. If you see this later in the draft, you should have a pretty good idea if itÅfs what your deck wants (and the answer will normally be ÅgnoÅh)."
"Minister of Inquiries",0.5,"Milling is not a supported theme in this set, so Minister has a long road ahead of him. He doesnÅft make that much energy, and even if your deck can generate a ton of energy, if you mill the opponent four times then this dies, you often will have accomplished nothing besides wasting time and energy."
"Nimble Innovator",3.0,"It doesnÅft take much for a card to earn its stripes, and drawing a card on ETB is plenty. This is on the higher end of the curve, but IÅfd still take and play multiples."
"Padeem, Consul of Innovation",3.5,"IÅfm going to deem this great, mainly because itÅfs not hard to make it a personal Howling Mine. A 4-mana 1/4 is only one mana more than average, and if you seek out 4-5 mana artifacts you should easily crush the competition. Hexproof is even a nice little bonus, meaning the opponent has to remove a 4-toughness creature before they can mess with the rest of your stuff."
"Paradoxical Outcome",1.0,"Look, I like Divination more than most, but this is a lot of hoops to jump through to draw a couple cards. I get that it saves your creatures, and can re-trigger ETB effects, but resetting your board to draw a couple cards seems like more trouble than itÅfs worth. IÅfm going to pass on this."
"Revolutionary Rebuff",1.5,"The odds that this goes dead are a little high for my taste, as 2?mana is not a lot once the game gets past turn 5?or 6. Once you factor in that it misses on artifacts, it looks even worse, and despite 2-mana counters being the good kind, this isnÅft revolutionary by any stretch."
"Saheeli's Artistry",4.0,"Given that there will almost always be an artifact in play, this card is great. Copying the best creature and the best artifact is well worth 6?mana, and even if you miss and just get a creature, itÅfs not the end of the world. If you draft this, try and bias toward picking up some good artifacts, and try to avoid trading off if itÅfs looking like you can set this up."
"Select for Inspection",1.5,"Upon further inspection, I kind of like this card. It canÅft bounce a blocker, which makes it less good in tempo decks (what is tempo, anyway?), but itÅfs still a solid combat trick. Scry 1 is a nice little bonus, and makes it better in the kinds of decks that arenÅft usually interested in bounce. ItÅfs neat that this is worse in decks that normally want bounce and better in the ones that donÅft, and I suspect it will play well."
"Shrewd Negotiation",3.0,"You clearly canÅft just play this in any deck (unless you are a very bad negotiator), but in a deck full of Servos it will thrive. The effect is insanely powerful, so if you can reliably pull it off, itÅfs a fantastic card."
"Tezzeret's Ambition",2.5,"Between Gambits and Ambition, Tezzeret draws a lot of cards. A planeswalker after my own heart indeed. 5?mana to draw three and discard one is passable in decks that want slow card draw, and the bonus of not having to discard is meaningful (though how good this is relies more on what your deck is trying to do than whether you have artifacts or not). This at common makes me think a control deck is possible, even if aggro decks arenÅft likely to play this."
"Thriving Turtle",2.0,"This is the kind of 1-drop I can get behind. Seriously, itÅfs going to protect me with its giant shell. The Turtle enables other energy cards,?or becomes a 1/4 for 1?(that is tapped for a turn), which are both good deals. If you end up with a deck that doesnÅft use energy otherwise and doesnÅft want blockers, this is cuttable, but most blue decks will want it."
"Torrential Gearhulk",4.0,"Torrential Gearhulk doesnÅft ask much of you. Play a few instants, get to 6?mana, and profit. IÅfd play this as a giant Ambush Viper (I guess that isnÅft a great comparison, because Gearhulk is very good) even in a deck without spells, and once you get to 4+ instants you really get to make it rain. You donÅft need to go out of your way to enable this, but itÅfs a good tiebreaker when you are deciding between an instant and a non-instant."
"Vedalken Blademaster",2.0,"This Vedalken may not be a genius, but itÅfs still playable. In a deck with 5+ spells, this does what you want, and is decent filler even with fewer spells (threat of activation makes it a hard card to block)."
"Weldfast Wingsmith",1.5,"A Hill Giant that takes to the sky when you play an artifact sounds passable on offense and medium on defense. ItÅfs playable if you need another creature, and goes up in value slightly if you are both aggressive and have a decent amount of artifacts. IÅfd rather not wing it, but every now and then you are caught unprepared."
"Wind Drake",2.5,"The cost-to-stats ratio here has always been solid in Limited, and will continue to be so. ItÅfs a tad better in aggressive decks, but a fine playable no matter what your strategy is (though not the most exciting of cards)."
"Aetherborn Marauder",3.5,"Marauder is an interesting card. By itself, itÅfs a 2/2 flying lifelink for 4, which is certainly acceptable. Move one counter onto it and it becomes a huge threat, two or more and your opponent will need to kill it or lose the game. That sounds like the kind of card IÅfm in forÅ\high floor, high ceiling. There are a lot of +1/+1 counter cards in this set, and when you have Aetherborn Marauder, you can lean toward getting counters rather than Servos off fabricate."
"Ambitious Aetherborn",3.0,"IÅfm happy with either side of this, though I expect to get a Servo more often than not. The name doesnÅft quite fit, as this card is way more solid than it is ambitious, and itÅfs a card IÅfm going to play every time (assuming I have room for 5s, of course)."
"Demon of Dark Schemes",5.0,"It doesnÅft get much better than this. A 5/5 flier that massacres the board and gives you a bunch of energy would be awesome if thatÅfs all it did, but somehow this also has a powerful activated ability that takes over the game. I donÅft know why the game would last?much longer, but if it does, youÅfve got a scheme at the ready."
"Dhund Operative",2.5,"A 3/2 deathtouch for 2?with the fail case of being a 2/2 is a fine deal. You arenÅft going to want this in decks without artifacts unless your curve is in bad shape, but the fact that itÅfs a curve-filler makes it a reasonable card to grab?even if you donÅft know where youÅfll end up."
"Diabolic Tutor",0.5,"The times you should play this are few and far between. ItÅfs way too expensive to play in a normal deck, as adding 4?to the cost of your best card isnÅft something you can just do in a game of Limited. However, if you end up in a control deck with a card like Demon of Dark Schemes or Fumigate, maybe you can play a Diabolic Tutor, but IÅfm still skeptical."
"Die Young",3.5,"IÅfd basically always play -2/-2 for 2?mana, and this does a few more good things. First of all, it combines with other energy cards to give larger minuses, as you can spend your hard-earned energy to bolster the effect. Second, if you kill a 1-toughness creature you end up with an extra energy, and you even have the option of not spending any energy at all if you have something else to do with it. That power level plus flexibility makes this a solid card."
"Dukhara Scavenger",2.0,"There are worse ways to spend 6?mana. Dukhara Scavenger provides a reasonable finisher to decks lacking in them, and even if it isnÅft a 2-for-1, replacing the top card of your deck with the best creature or artifact in your graveyard is a quality increase. I wouldnÅft want multiples of these, and itÅfs not a big deal if you donÅft get one, but having a single copy can be useful."
"Eliminate the Competition",3.0,"This is kind of an odd card. It certainly doesnÅft slot into just every deck, but the rating reflects that itÅfs good when it does fit. If you have a lot of ways to make tokens (fabricate springs to mind), you can eliminate all the competition, but in a normal deck itÅfs not going to be great. This will fluctuate between being a borderline playable and one of the best cards in your deck, depending on how well you enable it. ItÅfs also worth noting that sorcery-speed removal misses Vehicles, which is a big drawback in this set, and one that makes this card less appealing than it would be otherwise."
"Embraal Bruiser",2.0,"ThereÅfs a good amount of support for an artifact-heavy black aggro deck. I donÅft know how good that deck is going to end up being (has a lot of moving pieces), but I would certainly look to play Bruiser in it. Not being able to crew Vehicles or block the turn he comes in is a real drawback, though the payoff of a 3-power menace creature for 2?is worth going after."
"Essence Extraction",3.5,"Clean, efficient, and powerful. This is a great removal spell, and will never be a bad pick."
"Fortuitous Find",1.5,"I like me a draw-2, and find room for them in just about every deck. The only problem with this one is that you do need to have an artifact to get that second card, and not every deck is going to be able to swing that. This set is artifact-heavy enough that it still gets a solid rating, but be aware that you wonÅft always be able to play this."
"Foundry Screecher",2.5,"If you can reliably make this a 3/1, itÅfs the perfect card for your aggro deck. The fail-case of a 2/1 for three isnÅft too bad, and overall this is a reasonable playable, even in artifact-light decks."
"Fretwork Colony",1.0/3.0,"It may bug you that I put an aggro card in the build-around category, but this is such an all-or-nothing card that I think it belongs. ItÅfs an awesome 2-drop in a very focused beatdown deck, as it can run away with the game easily if you play it on turn 2. In midrange or control, itÅfs pretty close to unplayable, making it a card IÅfm not looking to take early. I also fear it being locked down with Malfunction or Revoke Privileges, as thatÅfs pretty hard to come back from.When this works, it will feel like Pack Rat. When it doesnÅft, itÅfs closer to a lone Lab Rats."
"Gonti, Lord of Luxury",3.5,"IÅfd be somewhat interested in a 2/3 deathtouch for 4?to begin with, so adding a powerful card draw ability takes this from Draft staple to Draft luxury. Bear in mind that Gonti doesnÅft have to survive in order for you to play the card, so feel free to trade him off if thatÅfs what the game demands."
"Harsh Scrutiny",1.5,"Adding a scry to this makes me so much happier to play it. One of the risks of discard is that you get punished harshly when you draw it later in the game (or when you miss because their hand doesnÅft meet the conditions), and getting to scry mitigates that. IÅfm still not automatically playing this, but am now willing to consider it, and it could be a great sideboard card against a creature-heavy deck with a high curve."
"Lawless Broker",2.5,"While this isnÅft broken, itÅfs not a card IÅfm looking to cut very often. ItÅfll trade for a card of comparable cost and leave you with a +1/+1 counter. ThatÅfs a fine deal."
"Live Fast",3.0,"I really wish this cost 2?and Die Young cost 3, so the proper curve could happen, but I guess the effects of the cards really dictated they have these names. Still, Divination gets me energized, and now it will do the same for anyone who wants to cast it. In a deck with zero cards that care about energy, this isnÅft the best, but I imagine almost every deck will find some kind of use for it. The speed of the format will also determine if this moves down half a grade or so, as beatdown decks will make paying 2?life a lot less feasible."
"Lost Legacy",0.0,"NO.I hate these kinds of cards, and this even gives your opponent the cards back if you snag any from their hand. Do not play this."
"Make Obsolete",3.5,"There seem to be a lot of small creatures running around this set, and IÅfm happy to pay 3?mana to wipe them all out. This being an instant also makes it a very good mid-combat play, as you can set up a situation where your 4/4 beats theirs and you kill a random 2/1. There are matchups where youÅfd board this out, but IÅfd take it early and always maindeck it."
"Marionette Master",4.0,"Much like Angel of Invention, this has reasons to pick either side of the fabricate, which is cool. If you already have a full board, making this a 4/6 that hits your opponent for 4?every time you lose an artifact seems sick, but in general the safe play will be to make a 1/3 and three 1/1s. Either way, you are getting a great deal, and Marionette Master is one of the better cards in the set."
"Maulfist Squad",3.0,"Both sides of this are great, and menace pays you off for choosing the +1/+1 counter version. This also fits perfectly in the black artifact aggro deck, while being a solid choice outside of that deck. You can do worse with squad goals, IÅfll say that."
"Midnight Oil",???(2.0),"What even is going on here? I had to read this card three times to get a sense, and now that I understand the mechanics, I still donÅft really know if itÅfs playable. LetÅfs try and break it down.? You draw an extra card every turn. This part is good, and I like it.So this is a high-powered card draw machine that is risky to play early and very good late. It also rewards a low curve heavily, further restricting where it can show up. Still, if you meet that condition and have room for a late-game card, this does look like it can do some work. This is one of those low-confidence ratings, and a few games (or one game) with the card will probably clear up any misconceptions. I can see this being awesome, as a deck full of cheap cards can really go off, but it also looks like you canÅft play it early and it can go wrong quickly."
"Mind Rot",1.0,"IÅfm happy playing this in Sealed or siding it in during Draft, but IÅfd rather not start it otherwise. I donÅft mind if I have to, I just donÅft like paying 3?to not affect the board, and discard falls off late game whereas card draw does?not."
"Morbid Curiosity",1.0,"I wanted to find out what would happen when I cast this with Wretched Gryff during spellslinging at PAX, and much like the proverbial cat, I got killed. Most of the time you are going to give up too much board position to really make this enticing, though it can break a stalled game wide open. To really make use of this, you need a defensive deck, and one that has cards you donÅft mind sacrificing. That wonÅft be most decks, but it will be some (and few other drafters are likely to take this from you)."
"Night Market Lookout",0.5,"Look, I get the jokeÅ\you tap this to crew a Vehicle. As cool as that combo is, unless your deck is the most aggressive mono-black deck IÅfve ever seen, this isnÅft a card IÅfd be in the market for. A 1/1 is just too small."
"Noxious Gearhulk",5.0,"IÅfve relaxed my standards for what gets a 5.0 in the last few reviews, though I think Noxious Gearhulk would have qualified no matter when I saw it. ItÅfs a huge, menacing creature that gives you a 2-for-1, gains a bunch of life, and likely puts you substantially ahead on mana. ThereÅfs literally nothing more you can ask for."
"Ovalchase Daredevil",3.5,"This blocks well enough that it can be annoying, and I wouldnÅft be surprised if this ended up as one of the chase uncommons of the set. If you drop this turn 4, your opponent really canÅft attack into it with confidence, and when you attack them, they are almost assuredly not blocking. ThatÅfs a pretty good deal for a creature thatÅfs only a touch smaller than it should be for its cost. Your opponent also has no way of knowing how many artifacts you have in your hand, so you can easily bluff in some damage or hold off attackers by keeping extra lands in the grip."
"Prakhata Club Security",2.0,"Solid stats for a reasonable cost. Join the club of filler, my friend."
"Rush of Vitality",2.5,"Not ever deck wants combat tricks, but those that do will be very happy with this one. ItÅfs going to be easy to trade 1-for-1 and gain a significant amount of life, and the indestructible clause makes this a good way to save your creatures from removal. That power plus flexibility is vital, and Rush is a card IÅfm happy to include as long as I have enough creatures."
"Subtle Strike",3.0,"ThereÅfs nothing subtle about thisÅ\itÅfs just great. Even if you are just using it to get a 1-for-1 and leave a counter behind, you got an advantage, and in some scenarios you will get the full blowout. Subtle Strike is solid, sweet, and will be sought after."
"Syndicate Trafficker",3.5,"The rating here is predicated on having?some amount of artifacts, but it really doesnÅft take many before this is a real threat. Eating Servos and growing larger, all while surviving combat or removal, sounds like a great deal to me."
"Thriving Rats",3.0,"These Rats do enough different things, all of them good, that IÅfm a fan of including them in any Limited deck.They attack as a 2/3, they generate energy for other cards, and can even consume any excess energy you have. The one downside they have is that they block as a 1/2 for the first turn, and sometimes arenÅft able to find a window to attack and get their counter, but thatÅfs minor at best."
"Tidy Conclusion",3.5,"IÅfm loathe to give expensive removal such a high grade, but this being an instant makes me think it will pull its weight. Unconditional kill spells donÅft grow on trees, and this can take down Vehicles and large creatures alike, sometimes gaining you a few life in the process. 5-drops do get worse in multiples, so donÅft go too nuts."
"Underhanded Designs",1.0/3.5,"This is the kind of build-around I can get behind. It drains the opponent a few times before killing their best creature, which is a great payoff. It wonÅft go into every deck, clearly, but is a card you can take early and fabricate a deck around."
"Weaponcraft Enthusiast",3.0,"A 2/3 for 3?doesnÅft sound like much, but I am enthusiastic about a 0/1 that comes with two 1/1s. ThatÅfs a good amount of stats, artifacts, and creatures all in one card. It also plays very nicely with bounce and flicker effects, or Raise Deads, making this a solid enabler for a bunch of different decks (while being fine in any deck)."
"Aethertorch Renegade",3.5,"A pinger with two shots still does most everything you want a pinger to do, and this is a lot more than that. It provides a significant chunk of energy for your other cards, and if you can get a bunch of reliable energy sources going, can torch the opponent out very quickly. Everything about this card is great."
"Brazen Scourge",3.5,"Boggart Ram-Gang is back, and itÅfs (mostly) easier to cast. IÅfm in. The stats-to-cost ratio here is great, and you should take and play this."
"Built to Smash",1.5,"Only targeting attackers limits this, but it does the job in an aggressive deck. Casting this on a large Vehicle will indeed be a smashing, and itÅfs hard to imagine not winning most combats where this comes out."
"Cathartic Reunion",1.5,"My initial reaction is that this is better than Tormenting Voice, because your second-worst card is more often than not worse than a random card from your deck. That wonÅft always be the case, but itÅfs close either way. Tormenting Voice with zero combos (see: Dragons of Tarkir) was filler more than anything, and thatÅfs about where Hug is going to land. Check back when it comes to Constructed, thoughÅ\this card does some work there."
"Chandra, Torch of Defiance",5.0,"I donÅft think this is going to be a tough nut to crack. Chandra is going to dominate any game sheÅfs played, and even if you play her when behind, she can take out a 4/4 and gain some life. If you can successfully protect her, she will run away with things, and all that for only 4?mana."
"ChandraÅfs Pyrohelix",3.5,"Flexibility + power for only 2 mana? Sign me up."
"Combustible Gearhulk",4.0,"This is a kind of strange ability, but "strange" doesnÅft mean "bad." Most Limited decks are going to deal roughly 5-6 damage by flipping three cards (according to my estimates of a normal curve), making this a 6-mana 6/6 that Lava Axes the opponent. IÅfm assuming you wonÅft draw cards very often, but even so, this is a great card."
"Demolish",0.5,"IÅfm not excited about paying 4?mana to kill an artifact, and sweetening the pot by letting me target lands isnÅft convincing me to run this. By all means, side it in if you get demolished by some sick Vehicle game one, but donÅft maindeck it."
"Fateful Showdown",3.5,"Deal 3-4 damage and make your hand better on average sounds like a great card to me. There will be situations where you donÅft have enough cards in hand to make this good, or your hand has a powerful 6-drop you donÅft want to discard, but they will be rare."
"Furious Reprisal",3.5,"It seems pretty easy to pick up a 2-for-1 with this, and worst comes to worst, you get to nug your opponent for 2. IÅfm in."
"Giant Spectacle",0.0,"Lunarch Mantle this is not, and Lunarch Mantle is a controversial card. This just doesnÅft do enough to warrant the risk you are taking by painting a giant target on one of your creatures."
"Harnessed Lightning",4.0,"It might be shocking how high a grade IÅfm giving this, but I value the combination of things it brings to the table. Not only is it 2 mana for an instant-speed deal 3, it can also enable other energy cards at a good rate or siphon off energy to deal a bunch more damage. ThatÅfs a lot of action for not a lot of mana, and exactly what IÅfm looking for."
"Hijack",1.5,"Threatens occupy a strange spot. They can be build-arounds, though this set doesnÅft appear to support that much. That leaves Hijack as a niche card for aggressive decks, as you canÅft play this in a midrange or control deck and expect it to perform. If you can steal a big blocker and kill the opponent, Hijack will be greatÅ\fail in that and itÅfs a dead card."
"Incendiary Sabotage",2.5,"Incendiary Sabotage is a strange one. ItÅfs a powerful effect with a strict requirement to cast, making it far from an auto-include. ItÅfs worth trying to enable, and picking up Puzzleknots or fabricate cards helps, as you should be able to maneuver this into providing a sizeable advantage. In the right deck, this is worth a lot, and in the wrong deck itÅfs uncastable."
"InventorÅfs Apprentice",1.5,"As a commenter on an earlier review pointed out, this will forever be known as Nerd Ape. ThatÅfs the most interesting thing about it, as itÅfs a marginal playable in most decks, really needing the bonus before it becomes a card of note (and not being more than just good even then)."
"Lathnu Hellion",3.5,"By itself, this is worth 8 damage, and it puts the opponent in a tough spot. They can refuse to trade for it, hoping youÅfll run out of energy, which can backfire if you follow it up with an energy creator or two. The rating drops substantially if your deck isnÅft aggressive and you have no ways to make energy, but meet either of those conditions and you have a real card on your hands."
"Madcap Experiment",0.0,"Either you have a ton of artifacts in your deck, meaning that by playing this you are paying a decent amount of life for something worth less than 4?mana on average, or you have very few, so casting this kills you. IÅfm not interested in either scenario."
"Maulfist Doorbuster",3.0,"This is clearly a beatdown card, and a good one at that. Setting up good attacks at least twice is worth the risk of having 2?toughness, and the energy cost is low enough that any other energy card will open the door for multiple extra attacks."
"Pia Nalaar",3.5,"Pia may not be as powerful as her daughter, but sheÅfs still pretty strong. A 2/2 plus a 1/1 flier is already good, and Pia has multiple abilities that both work with that Thopter and stay relevant even after itÅfs gone. You donÅft have to go deep into artifacts to make Pia good, though she does get a bit better if you do."
"Quicksmith Genius",2.5,"This guy looks a little too pleased with himself. Despite that, I still am willing to give him a good grade, as he will play out well in a deck with even 5+ artifacts. You arenÅft paying much for the ability, and getting just one rummage out of the deal should put you ahead of the game."
"Reckless Fireweaver",1.0,"Thermo-Alchemist this is not. I just donÅft see decks having enough artifacts to really go off with this, and a 1/3 that has to attack to deal damage is so much worse than a pinger."
"Renegade Tactics",1.5,"If you have room in your deck, this sort of card is never bad, but itÅfs also never really worth prioritizing. ItÅfs air, and unless you are super aggressive, not going to be an important component."
"Ruinous Gremlin",1.0,"As a 1-drop, this is anemic, and as an artifact removal spell, itÅfs ruinously expensive. Still, the combination is flexible, and if you have to play this, it isnÅft the end of the world. IÅfd still prefer to sideboard this in, unless the format is more artifact dominated than it looks."
"Salivating Gremlins",2.0,"IÅfd bump this up a full grade if you can enable it most turns, but itÅfs not something IÅfm drooling over in most decks."
"Skyship Stalker",4.0,"A Dragon thatÅfs castable on turn 4?and great on turn 10? IÅfm in."
"Spark of Creativity",2.5,"This is an interesting card. You can mitigate the randomness here by only targeting creatures with toughness low enough that you can play any card that fails to kill them. For example, if you have four lands in play (and havenÅft played a land yet), targeting a 4/4 will either kill it or reveal something that costs 3?or less. This isnÅft foolproof, as you could hit a pump spell or some other situational card, but it does mean that you can almost always get a card out of this. That seems reasonable to me, even if itÅfs not a very reliable way to kill anything."
"Speedway Fanatic",2.5,"A 2/1 haste is a nice little beater, and giving Vehicles haste makes your opponent worry about getting hit by a freight train at any point. You donÅft need Vehicles for this to be playable, though clearly you have?incentive to pick some up."
"Spireside Infiltrator",1.5,"IÅfm not a huge fan of the Ågwhen tappedÅh creatures in this set (Night Market Lookout being the other). The combo with Vehicles just isnÅft enough of a driving force to get me to play medium-rate creatures, though this is at least passable based on stats alone. Play this if you need a 3-drop, maybe over something else if you have 3+ Vehicles, but donÅft treat it like a build-around."
"Spontaneous Artist",3.0,"Not all energy cards are high on synergy, and Spontaneous Artist does just fine on its own. A 4-mana 3/3 haste is a good deal, and having additional combos is just a bonus."
"Start Your Engines",0.5,"I predict that I will not be starting very many engines. Sorcery-speed +2/+0 is just not appealing, and IÅfd rather just play a creature that can crew Vehicles every turn instead of a card that might just be dead. Still, I also predict that I will die to three Vehicles powered by this at least once."
"Territorial Gorger",2.5,"It doesnÅft seem too hard to get this to attack as a 4/4 multiple times per game, though I wouldnÅft expect it to be a 6/6 all that often. Bear in mind that itÅfs +2/+2 per instance of gaining energy, even if you are gaining multiples at the same time."
"Terror of the Fairgrounds",0.5,"My newfound love for Hulking Devil aside, 5/2 is just really terrible stats. This trades down for basically anything, and is rarely going to get through."
"Thriving Grubs",3.0,"A solid collection of stats and an ability that plays well with or without other cards. IÅfm into it."
"Wayward Giant",1.5,"Not the most exciting card, but not one IÅfd be ashamed to play either. Wayward Giant requires more chumping than just a Servo, and is big enough to survive most combats. I also hear Ågcarry on my wayward giantÅh every time I see this."
"Welding Sparks",3.5,"Zzzzzt. You should take this and play it, even if you have zero artifacts in your deck. If you have more than zero, congrats, you made a good card even better."
"Appetite for the Unnatural",1.0,"I canÅft really stomach maindecking this unless itÅfs Sealed. The reason I like Fragmentize?is that you are getting ahead when you use it, but the fact that Appetite costs?3?makes it more of an even trade. That, combined with the risk of missing, makes me put this in the sideboard category more than the main deck category."
"Arborback Stomper",3.5,"Thragtusk (minus the friend) is still a great card. Arborback Stomper keeps you alive long enough to make use of a giant 5/4 trampler, and even if itÅfs immediately killed or bounced you got a good deal."
"Architect of the Untamed",3.5,"This strikes me as a great?card. By itself you arenÅft getting to 8?energy all that easily, but it does such a good job of fueling other energy cards or taking their energy that IÅfd be thrilled to start with it. A 2/3 for 3?isnÅft even that bad, so taking it early seems like low risk and high reward."
"Armorcraft Judge",3.0,"Armorcraft Judge is another card that fits into the Åglow risk, high rewardÅh category. The fail case of a Hill Giant is decent, and the upside of drawing one or more extra cards is very appealing. Green has a lot of ways to get +1/+1 counters, and that theme is even carried across all five colors, making this a solid addition to most decks."
"Attune with Aether",2.5,"This isnÅft quite an auto-play, since a deck thatÅfs evenly split across two colors and doesnÅft care about energy shouldnÅft run it, but itÅfs a good way to get energy in a base-green deck. You can even draft multiples and start replacing lands, as long as youÅfre willing to play 11-12 Forests."
"Blossoming Defense",2.5,"I really like how efficient this is. Countering a removal spell or winning a combat for only 1?mana is great, and more than enough to make me overcome my aversion to combat tricks."
"Bristling Hydra",4.0,"A 4-mana 5/4 with upside? ThatÅfs heading straight into my deck, even if I have no other energy cards (and it clearly gets better with them)."
"Commencement of Festivities",0.5,"The festivities will not be commencing on my watch. This is strictly sideboard material unless your opponent has an Overrun-type effect that you canÅft beat otherwise."
"Cowl Prowler",1.5,"If you need a 6-drop, this is a 6-drop.ThatÅfs about the extent of my analysis, and suitably describes my excitement level about this card."
"Creeping Mold",0.5,"This is a slightly worse Appetite for the Unnatural, much like it got left somewhere damp for too long."
"Cultivator of Blades",4.0,"Both sides of this are awesome, and which you pick is mostly dependent on what the board looks like. If you have a bunch of other creatures, this likely plays better as a 3/3, and if your board is empty, Servos it is. It also works well with pump spells, though those are not needed for this to be excellent."
"Dubious Challenge",0.0,"Look, even I have standards. Not only is this card clearly unplayable, but the joke about the name is just too easy. LetÅfs just move on."
"Durable Handicraft",1.0,"This was a cause of much debate on the Limited Resources Set Review (which is a good supplement to these reviews, if you are looking for a way to spend four hours with myself and Marshall). We settled on this being bad, though this is one of the cards IÅfm least certain about.It costs a lot of mana before you get enough counters for this to be worth it, and the idea of topdecking this sounds horrendous. The activated ability helps a little bit, but not enough for me to really be comfortable, and until I have a chance to test this Handicraft for myself, IÅfm going to go with Ågbad.Åh"
"Elegant Edgecrafters",3.0,"Magic is a game about small edges, and I like to think of myself as an Elegant Edgecrafter. OK, maybe that isnÅft the best analogy, but this card is still a good one. A hard-to-block 5/6 is worth 6?mana, and a 3/4 plus two 1/1s is a fine deal too. I like the fabricate cards where both choices make sense, and this is one IÅfm happy to cast for either side."
"Fairgrounds Trumpeter",2.0,"It doesnÅft take too much before IÅfd put this in my deck, as one counter later and this is a good deal. ItÅfs unplayable without any support, but itÅfs not hard to find that?support."
"Ghirapur Guide",2.0,"3/2 for 3 isnÅft my favorite set of stats, because of how often it trades down for a 2-drop. That said, having an evasive ability makes this a lot more relevant in the late game than most 3-drops, and thatÅfs worth something."
"Highspire Artisan",2.0,"IÅfm not as high on this as other fabricate cards, but itÅfs a solid addition to any defensive deck. A 1/4 reach for 3?will certainly do a good job keeping you alive, and IÅfd expect thatÅfs the mode this gets played in most often. If you need an artifact, playing this as an 0/3 is serviceable, but a little below the curve."
"Hunt the Weak",3.0,"Though this card hasnÅft always impressed me, I donÅft think it will be weak in this set. Green has some really big commons, and the +1/+1 counter theme gives it additional utility. Add those together and you have the makings of a solid removal spell."
"Kujar Seedsculptor",3.0,"A 2/3 for 2?with upside is a great deal, and it doesnÅft take much sculpting before you have a board where this does good things. This even plays nicely with the +1/+1 counter theme, which is just a bonus given?the stats you are already underpaying for."
"Larger Than Life",0.0,"The rating is smaller than ideal, since sorcery-speed pump spells are more akin to Lava Axe than Giant Growth. Unreliable Lava Axes are not my idea of a good time."
"Longtusk Cub",3.0,"Longtusk Cub can run away with a game when played early, and is a perfectly acceptable energy sink (and source) late. There are games where this is just a 2/2 with no text, but they are more than made up for by the games where it just steamrolls the opponent."
"NatureÅfs Way",3.5,"Talk about taking a bite out of crime. This will kill most things you care about and let your creature march in with some new abilities, at least temporarily. Note that itÅfs not a fight, just a mauling, and you can play this without fear of too much of a blowout if they have a pump spell."
"Nissa, Vital Force",4.5,"You canÅft ask for much?more here. Your opponent is forced to try and kill Nissa if you +1 her, as the ultimate will let you win any game that lasts more than a few turns, and hitting for 5?plus casting Regrowths make for great abilities too. Nissa is a little vulnerable to fliers, as planeswalkers tend to be, but thatÅfs about the only place she needs help."
"Ornamental Courage",1.5,"This is a run-of-the-mill combat trick, which puts it fairly low on my priority list. ItÅfs enough stats with a minor ability that IÅfll likely run it, but IÅfm not that excited to do so."
"Oviya Pashiri, Sage Lifecrafter",2.5,"At 1?mana, Oviya comes out basically for free, which makes her expensive activated ability less of a burden than on something like Whirlermaker. SheÅfs an annoyance at worst and a game-ender at best, which is a good deal for this cost."
"Peema Outrider",3.5,"A common 4/4 trampler for 4?with upside, eh? This is where we are at these days? This can even come out as a 3/3 and a 1/1, if thatÅfs better, and no matter which side you choose you are going to?take your opponent for a ride."
"Riparian Tiger",3.0,"The Tiger is grrreat too, though slightly behind the outrageous curve set by Peema Outrider. A 6/6 attacker that works well with other energy cards is a bargain for 5?mana, and this does plenty even if you never spend energy on it."
"Sage of Shaila's Claim",1.5,"Given how bad 2/1s look in this format, you should only be playing this if you have 4-5+ good energy sinks. Once you do, I wonÅft claim itÅfs unplayable, but IÅfm still not excited."
"Servant of the Conduit",3.5,"A 2/2 for 2 that taps for mana is incredibly good. Mana accelerants are absurd when played on turn 2, and this isnÅft a dead draw later, thanks to its stats. Yes, it can run out of energy, but the first couple uses are the most important anyway, and you can use other cards to power it if need be."
"Take Down",0.5,"This is a sideboard card. ItÅfs a good sideboard card, but it sure wonÅft fly main deck."
"Thriving Rhino",3.0,"Thriving Rhino is a good card in any deck, energy-based or not. It gets a little better with other energy cards, but they are in no way necessaryÅ\the stats here justify it by itself."
"Verdurous Gearhulk",5.0,"The stats-to-cost ratio here isnÅft remotely realistic, and 4 points?of those stats even have haste. By itself, this is an 8/8 trampler for 5, which is silly, and itÅfs much better than that. This gets the top grade because it can engineer a comeback, while being unbeatable if you are ahead. ThatÅfs a lot for just 5?mana."
"Wild Wanderer",2.0,"If you are playing three colors or have a high curve, this is a fine addition. IÅfm not wild about it otherwise, though itÅfs passable just because it is a 2-for-1, and only slightly smaller than what IÅfd want for 4?mana."
"Wildest Dreams",2.5,"This is the kind of control finisher that I dream about, while being a little pricey for most aggro decks. 5?mana to draw the two best cards from your graveyard is a solid deal, and if you can stall the game and cast this for 3+, you should just win."
"Wily Bandar",1.0,"Cat monkey! Also too small and with too expensive of an ability! DonÅft play this!"
"Cloudblazer",4.0(ButIreallywanttogiveita4.5),"Cloudblazer is excellent, provides tons of value, and even gains you a little life if you are behind. This does work with blink and bounce, but honestly, you donÅft need any of that for it to be amazing. Just cast it, and profit."
"Contraband Kingpin",3.0,"It doesnÅft take much before Contraband Kingpin earns his keep, and even if you have zero artifacts IÅfd still run him. A 1/4 lifelink is worth 2?mana, and free scrys sounds awesome."
"Depala, Pilot Exemplar",4.0,"Depala seems like the real deal. SheÅfs a 3/3 for 3, meaning she can never be awful, and works very well with many of the red and white cards in the set. None of these abilities dwarf the others, but they all combine well enough to make her a flagship card thatÅfs worth building around."
"Dovin Baan",4.0,"Dovin may not be Chandra, but he does a decent job protecting himself and draws you a stream of cards once you stabilize the board. ThatÅfs about all I ask from a planeswalker, and heÅfs worth going for."
"Empyreal Voyager",3.5,"An aggressively-costed flier that generates 2?energy a turn is great in energy decks and good outside them. That makes this an easy hit, and a card IÅfd be happy taking early and building around."
"Engineered Might",1.5,"In the green-white go-wide deck, this is a good finisher. Outside of that, itÅfs nigh-unplayable, as paying a bunch of mana for a sorcery-speed pump is not where you want to be."
"Hazardous Conditions",1.5,"IÅfm very skeptical of this card. Between Vehicles, opposing +1/+1 counters, and giant creatures, what exactly is this killing? Servos? IÅfm going to hazard a guess and say this is closer to a sideboard card than a main-deck one."
"Kambal, Consul of Allocation",3.5,"One trigger from this and youÅfve gotten a good dealÅ\two or more and youÅfve stolen an incredible amount of resources. IÅfd always slam Kambal, and be very happy doing so."
"Rashmi, Eternities Crafter",UpdatedRating:?4.0,"As much as I like drawing extra cards, it takes some work for this to pan out. You have to play a card that uses about half your mana, and hope to hit something that costs less, with lands or expensive cards being a miss. ThatÅfs a few too many misses for my taste, leaving Rashmi at playable rather than amazing.Author's Note: I misread Rashmi, and thought you had to pay for the 2nd spell. The rating has been adjusted accordingly."
"Restoration Gearsmith",3.5,"ItÅfs not hard to get a card out of this, and when you do you end up with a fantastic deal. That, combined with a Ågfail caseÅh of a 4-mana 3/3, leaves you with a solid early pick."
"Saheeli Rai",1.5,"There arenÅft many mediocre planeswalkers in Limited, but they do exist, and Saheeli is one of them. None of her abilities protect her, unless you are cloning things with fabricate, and the payoff isnÅft huge. 3-mana planeswalkers are a lot stronger in Constructed, where games are faster and mana is more important."
"Unlicensed Disintegration",4.0,"IÅfm going to ask Ågwho licensed that disintegrationÅh every time this gets cast, but there are plenty of other good things going on too. This is an unconditional removal spell with upside, and for only 3?mana, making it a clear early pick."
"Veteran Motorist",3.5,"I like everything thatÅfs going on here. This is a great Vehicle engine, and even in a deck without them, more than pulls its weight. A 3/1 with scry 2 is great, and you arenÅft paying much for any of these abilities."
"Voltaic Brawler",4.0,"A 2-mana 4/3 trampler is absurd, and this isnÅft much short of that. You donÅft need other energy cards to make this tick, but they certainly canÅft hurt."
"Whirler Virtuoso",3.5,"A 3-mana 2/3 that comes with a 1/1 flier is a good amount of stats spread among two creatures, and one any deck is interested in. You arenÅft all that likely to make additional Thopters, given the steep energy cost, but stranger things have happened."
"Aether Hub",2.0,"I wouldnÅft play this in a 2-color deck without energy, but in a 3-color deck or an energy deck, this is solid."
"Enemy Fastlands",3.0,"The normal caveats applyÅ\donÅft pick these over much, but if you are in those two colors, you should play them."
"InventorÅfs Fair",1.5,"If you have a ton of artifacts, this is fair, but not amazing. It gives you a solid amount of late game without using a spell slot, and just asks that you play a colorless land."
"Sequestered Stash",1.5,"Putting an artifact back on top makes me very sad. ItÅfs not drawing a card, and not usually worth destabilizing your mana.
